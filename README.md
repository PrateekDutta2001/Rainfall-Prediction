This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

Data has been collected from online public source. It's in .csv format. Further it has been processed and model has been implemented.

Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.

ANNs are digitized models of a human brain, computer programs designed to simulate the way in which human brain processes information. ANNs learn (or are trained) through experience with appropriate learning exemplars just as people do, not from programming. ANN is generally used in cases where what has happened in past is repeated almost exactly in same way.
